# Client Qualification Criteria Framework

## Overview
This framework helps you systematically evaluate prospects to identify clients where you can deliver maximum value and achieve the best ROI. Use this before investing significant time in discovery calls or proposals.

---

## 1. Qualification Scoring System

### How It Works
- Rate each prospect across 6 key dimensions
- Each dimension scored 0-5 points (30 points maximum)
- **20+ points = Qualified** (Schedule discovery call)
- **15-19 points = Maybe** (Gather more info first)
- **<15 points = Not a fit** (Politely decline or defer)

---

### Dimension 1: Problem Size & Impact (0-5 points)

**What we're evaluating:** Is the problem significant enough to justify investment in AI?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Mission-critical process; business stops without it; high pain level |
| 4 | High-impact process; significant inefficiency or cost |
| 3 | Moderate impact; noticeable problem but not urgent |
| 2 | Low impact; nice-to-have optimization |
| 1 | Minimal impact; exploring AI out of curiosity |
| 0 | No clear problem; fishing for ideas |

**Red flags (auto-disqualify):**
- No clear problem articulated
- "We just want to try AI and see what happens"
- Problem is minor annoyance, not business issue

---

### Dimension 2: Financial Capacity (0-5 points)

**What we're evaluating:** Can they afford our services and see ROI?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Annual revenue $5M+; clear budget allocated; ROI-focused |
| 4 | Annual revenue $1-5M; budget available; value-conscious |
| 3 | Annual revenue $500K-1M; limited budget but motivated |
| 2 | Annual revenue $100-500K; tight budget; price-sensitive |
| 1 | Annual revenue <$100K; very limited resources |
| 0 | No budget; wants free work or "equity" deals |

**Minimum thresholds:**
- Must have revenue >$100K annually
- Must have budget of at least $5K for initial project
- Should be able to recoup investment within 12 months based on baseline metrics

**Red flags:**
- "What's the cheapest option?"
- "Can we do a revenue share instead?"
- "We'll pay you after we get funding"

---

### Dimension 3: Measurable Baseline Metrics (0-5 points)

**What we're evaluating:** Can we capture baseline data and prove ROI?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Comprehensive data available; tracking systems in place; quantifiable costs |
| 4 | Good data availability; can estimate key metrics accurately |
| 3 | Some data available; willing to track and measure |
| 2 | Limited data; mostly estimates but committed to improvement |
| 1 | No data; unwilling or unable to track metrics |
| 0 | Refuses to share data or provide estimates |

**Must-have metrics (at least 3 of these):**
- Current labor costs (hours × rates)
- Process volume (tasks/tickets/transactions per period)
- Error rates or rework costs
- Time to complete standard tasks
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Revenue or conversion rates

**Red flags:**
- "I don't know" to all baseline questions
- Unwilling to share financial/operational data
- No interest in measuring results

---

### Dimension 4: Decision-Making Authority (0-5 points)

**What we're evaluating:** Can this person make the decision or influence it?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Owner/CEO/President; sole decision-maker; can approve immediately |
| 4 | C-level executive with budget authority; minimal approval needed |
| 3 | Department head with influence; needs 1-2 approvals |
| 2 | Manager; multiple approval layers; long decision process |
| 1 | Individual contributor; no authority; gathering info for someone else |
| 0 | Student/researcher; no buying authority |

**Ideal scenarios:**
- Speaking directly with decision-maker
- Timeline to decision is <4 weeks
- Clear approval process outlined

**Red flags:**
- "I need to talk to my boss/partner/committee"
- No clear timeline for decision
- Multiple stakeholders with unclear roles

---

### Dimension 5: Technical Feasibility (0-5 points)

**What we're evaluating:** Can we technically solve this problem with AI?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Clear use case; proven AI solutions exist; straightforward implementation |
| 4 | Good use case; standard AI approach applicable; moderate complexity |
| 3 | Viable use case; some customization needed; achievable |
| 2 | Edge case; requires significant custom development; risky |
| 1 | Questionable fit for AI; may not be technically feasible |
| 0 | Not an AI problem; should use different solution |

**Strong fit for AI:**

| 2 | Unrealistic expectations; resistant to change; low tech literacy |
| 1 | Magical thinking about AI; significant resistance expected |
| 0 | Expects AI to be free/instant/perfect; unwilling to change processes |

**Positive indicators:**
- Understands AI is a tool, not magic
- Willing to adapt processes to work with AI
- Team is open to new technology
- Previous experience with tech implementations

**Red flags:**
- "Can AI do everything for us?"
- "We don't want to change anything"

## 8. Sample Responses

### Declining a Poor-Fit Prospect

```
Subject: Re: AI Automation Inquiry

Hi [Name],

Thank you for reaching out and for taking the time to share information about your needs.

After reviewing your situation, I don't think we're the best fit for this project at this time. Based on what you've shared, [specific reason: the current process costs/company stage/timeline/etc.] suggests that the ROI on an AI solution may not justify the investment right now.

However, I'd recommend [alternative suggestion: simple automation tool, process improvement, revisiting in 6-12 months, etc.].

I've also attached a free resource on [relevant topic] that you might find helpful.

If your situation changes or you'd like to revisit this down the line, feel free to reach out.

Best of luck,
[Your Name]
```

## 9. Continuous Improvement

### Track Qualification Accuracy

For each client project, track:
- **Initial qualification score**
- **Actual ROI achieved**
- **Client satisfaction**
- **Profitability of engagement**

### Quarterly Review

Every quarter, analyze:
- What score range predicts best clients?
- Which dimensions are most predictive?
- Are there patterns in our best/worst clients?
- Should we adjust qualification criteria?

### Iterate Based on Data

- Successful clients with low initial scores → criteria may be too strict
- Poor outcomes despite high scores → missing important factors
- Consistent red flags missed → add to disqualification list

---

## 10. Key Takeaways

✅ **Use objective scoring** - Don't rely on gut feel alone

✅ **Qualify early** - Save time by filtering before discovery calls

✅ **Set minimums** - Revenue, budget, problem size thresholds prevent wasted effort

✅ **Track data** - Use baseline metrics not just for clients, but for your own qualification accuracy

✅ **Be willing to say no** - Declining poor-fit clients protects your reputation and resources

✅ **Continuously refine** - Your qualification criteria should evolve as you learn what makes a successful engagement

---

**Remember:** Every poor-fit client you decline creates capacity for an ideal client who will get great results, become a case study, and refer others. Qualification isn't about being elitist—it's about ensuring mutual success.
