# Onboarding Command Center

**Purpose**: Orchestrate the entire client onboarding journey from contract signing to successful handoff.

## Overview

The Command Center is mission control for all active client onboardings. It provides visibility, automation, and coordination across the entire journey.

## Core Components

- Day 4 training reminder
- Day 7 satisfaction survey
- Week 2 optimization scheduler
- Month 1 handoff coordination

### 4. Escalation Workflows

**Red Flags** (immediate escalation):
- Client non-responsive for 48+ hours
- Satisfaction score <6
- Critical blocker (missing access, technical issues)
- Delayed milestone by 3+ days

**Escalation Actions**:
1. Alert assigned onboarding specialist
2. Notify team lead if unresolved in 24h
3. Executive touch-point if unresolved in 48h
4. Document root cause and resolution

## Daily Workflow

**Morning (9:00 AM)**:
1. Review dashboard for all active clients
2. Check overnight automations (emails sent, tasks triggered)
3. Identify any red flags or blockers
4. Plan day's client touchpoints

**Throughout Day**:
5. Execute scheduled client calls/meetings
6. Update milestone progress in real-time
7. Address escalated issues
8. Coordinate with other departments as needed

**End of Day (5:00 PM)**:
9. Update all client statuses
10. Schedule next day's automations
11. Brief team on critical issues
12. Prepare tomorrow's priority list

## Weekly Workflow

## Metrics to Track

**Volume Metrics**:
- Active onboardings in progress
- New clients entered this week
- Clients handed off this week
- Average onboarding duration

**Quality Metrics**:
- Milestone completion rates
- On-time completion percentage
- Client satisfaction scores
- Escalation frequency

**Efficiency Metrics**:
- Agency hours per client onboarding
- Automation vs. manual touchpoint ratio
- Response time to client questions
- Time-to-first-win

## Integration Points

**With Other Departments**:
- **Client Success Operations**: Feed progress data for analytics
- **Client Strategy & Alignment**: Coordinate on OBG definition and roadmap
- **Client Education**: Trigger training sequences at milestones
- **AI Agent Factory**: Deploy agents for specific client needs

**With External Tools**:
- CRM system (client records, deal stages)
- Project management (task tracking)
- Email platform (automated sequences)
- Communication tools (Slack, Teams)
- Analytics dashboard

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Dashboard**: Create tracking spreadsheet or tool integration
2. **Configure Milestones**: Customize checklist templates for your service offerings
3. **Build Automation**: Set up email sequences and reminder triggers
4. **Train Team**: Ensure all onboarding specialists understand the workflow
5. **Pilot Test**: Run 3-5 clients through the system before full rollout

## Continuous Improvement

**Monthly Review Questions**:
- Which milestones are most commonly delayed?
- What are the top 3 escalation reasons?
- Are automations working as expected?
- What manual tasks could be automated?
- How can we reduce time-to-first-win?

**Optimization Cycle**:
1. Collect data on bottlenecks
2. Analyze root causes
3. Design improvements (new automation, better templates)
4. Test with pilot clients
5. Roll out if successful
6. Monitor impact

**Remember**: The goal is not perfection, but consistent, high-quality onboarding that delivers value fast while minimizing agency effort.
